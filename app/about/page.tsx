          Our Story
        </h1>
        <p className="text-brand-gray text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Walkzen Footwear was born from a simple realization: the modern world demands constant motion, yet most footwear isn`t built to keep up comfortably. We grew tired of choosing between shoes that looked great but caused blisters, and shoes that felt great but lacked style. So, we set out to engineer the perfect balance.
